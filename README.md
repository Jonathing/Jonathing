### Hi, I'm Jonathing.

## I write music

- I am currently studying Music Composition in college and am looking to be a professional composer! While it may not seem like it, I have already written some pieces behind the scenes.
- Please read my [public Gist](https://gist.github.com/dfdae37e09d969ea1d8b0166f10fa99e) where I discuss my policy on what and how you can use my music.

## I'm also a programmer

- How could I be on GitHub and not have any sort of relation with computer programming? I code in Java, and I am learning other OOP languages such as C# and Go.
- I am mainly known online for helping around with Minecraft mods. I am a community manager, programmer, and musician for [Cryptic Mushroom](https://crypticmushroom.com/) and a programmer and musician for [Modding Legacy](https://moddinglegacy.com/).
